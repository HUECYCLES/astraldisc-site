			<p>It's beautiful day out!</p>
			<p>Birds are singing, flowers are blooming...</p>
			<p>Especially. The flowers.</p>

			<p>Don't you just love the sweet aroma of roses? Here's a bouquet!</p>

				(Why do I smell gunpowder...?)
			</span></p>

			<p>Hello, and welcome once again! It's nice to be here for another newsletter... 2025 is already passing by in the blink of an eye.</p>
			<p>
				The team is under a semi-hiatus still, and it was planned for this break to continue up until the new chapters were released, but, some of us missed the project dearly....
				Motivation will always fluctuate as we have busy lives, but we're slowly chipping away at things again and we'd like to show some of the progress we got done today. 
			</p>

			<h2 class="center">The Return of CANDLEHOLDER?!</h2>
			<p>That's right! CANDLEHOLDER is back from hiatus!</p>
			<p>
				After 2 and a half years with its development halted, we're ready to tackle CANDLEHOLDER again.
				We've been honing our skills as programmers, writers and sprite artists during this time, and as ASTRAL DISC grew and evolved, so will CANDLEHOLDER.
			</p>
			<p>
				It'll be going through a semi-major rewrite, have an entire visual update, polish and update the soundtrack, go through MAJOR internal reorganizing (it needs it), and overall shaping itself up to the best it can be!
				Now that it's fully integrated into ASTRAL DISC, expect major (and more frequent) updates very soon.
			</p>

			<p>We've worked very very hard on this update (actual character information pages, FINALLY!!) and will keep bringing new stuff for you to see as time passes. Wonder if you can find some secrets within as well...?</p>
			<p>Who knows.</p>
