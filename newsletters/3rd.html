			</p>
			<p>Greetings, once again! Crazy how it's been 3 years since this project started, hasn't it?!</p>
			<p>Even though we're only celebrating several days later...</p>
			<p><span class="newsletter-tiny">
				(When it was completed. Not when it was published. It's already March 2025, oops)
			</span></p>
			<p>Sorry for the delay! This might be a smaller newsletter than the others, but we urge you to read it still! Without further ado, let's talk about our latest achievements...</p>
			
			<h2 class="center">You Renamed the Project?!</h2>
			<p>That's right! The project has gone through another renaming. Well, third time's the charm...</p>
			<p>Say goodbye to "Andromedia", and hello to "ASTRAL DISC". The old name seemed a bit redundant when we had something like "ASTRAL DISC" already around, not to mention that "Andromedia" isn't THAT unique (it's already used in domain names, social media handles AND the name of an old movie...), as well as not having a clear enough meaning.</p>
			<p>The website domain, and all mentions of the old project name have now been updated. We ask that from now on, please refer to the project as "ASTRAL DISC".</p>
			<p><span style="font-size: var(--font-tiny); color: var(--faint-text); text-shadow: none;">
				(Candleholder is still "Candleholder". Don't worry.)
			</span></p>
			
			<h2 class="center">Even More Progress...</h2>
			<p>We've been making lots of progress with the overall structure of the chapters, general timeline, progress documents... mostly internal stuff. Following the name change, we have also started polishing the chapter selection system we had in place, and it is now much more stable!</p>
			<p>Chapter 3 and Chapter 4 are our main focus right now, with Chapter 5 also getting a few fun things here and there, like certain shops, polishing a certain segment in it, and many more changes and updates.</p>
			<p class="center">

				<img class="pixelated" src="../assets/img/newsletters/2024/3rd/quest_ch5.png">
			</p>
			<p>With this new reorganizing and rebranding of the project, we're hoping things run way more smoothly from now on!</p>

			<h2 class="center">Website Update</h2>
			<p>Remember when this website used to be COOL? Well, now you can explore to your heart's delight, like old times!</p>
			<p>We've worked very very hard on this update (actual character information pages, FINALLY!!) and will keep bringing new stuff for you to see as time passes. Wonder if you can find some secrets within as well...?</p>
			<p>Who knows.</p>

			<h2 class="center">Closing Thoughts</h2>
			<p class="center">

			</p>
			<p>While we were cooking things for this website, time for this newsletter ran short. So, it became rather pocket-sized...</p>
			<p>But we, as a team, wanted to take this moment to thank you all for sticking with us even when burnout hit for a while. We're all glad to have built such a tight-knit community and can only hope it withstands the next BIG change in fandom environment when Toby drops the official Chapters 3-4.</p>
			<p>We're very close to that day now, and we'd like to say that despite what people may think, we'll still be here, as an AU of a game we love, made entirely for fun, driven by creativity and passion.</p>
			<p>We are all very proud of what we've been making and want to share the final product with those who have faith in this project.</p>
			<p>Once again, most of all...</p>
			
			<h2 class="center">Thank you!</h2>
